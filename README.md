Central bank of Uzbekistan has limit for historical currency exchange rate data export (max 1 month) on https://cbu.uz/uz/arkhiv-kursov-valyut/, but I needed 5 years of data for a volatility analysis research. 

This app downloads CBU hitorical currency exchange rate data for custom currency (against UZS) on custom data frame if availbale.
